                <h2>Understanding Force</h2>
                <p>Force is defined as a push or pull on an object resulting from its interaction with another object. It can cause an object to start moving, stop, change direction, or change shape. The unit of force is the Newton (N).</p>
    
                <h3>Characteristics of Force</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vector Quantity:</strong> Force has both magnitude (how strong) and direction (where it is applied).</li>
                    <li><strong>Net Force:</strong> The total force acting on an object when all the individual forces are combined.</li>
                    <li><strong>Balanced and Unbalanced Forces:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Balanced Forces:</em> Forces that are equal in size and opposite in direction, resulting in no change in motion.</li>
                            <li><em>Unbalanced Forces:</em> Forces that cause a change in motion due to a net force acting on an object.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>Examples of Force in Daily Life</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pushing a shopping cart in a store.</li>
                    <li>Pulling a suitcase while walking.</li>
                    <li>Applying brakes in a car to slow down.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>Types of Forces</h3>
                <p>Forces can be classified into two main categories:</p>
    
                <h4>1. Contact Forces</h4>
                <p>Contact forces require physical interaction between objects. Examples include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Friction:</strong> A force that opposes the motion of an object. It acts when two surfaces are in contact. Friction can vary based on the texture of the surfaces and the force pressing them together.</li>
                    <li><strong>Muscular Force:</strong> The force exerted by muscles, such as when lifting weights or pushing objects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mechanical Force:</strong> The force generated by the means of a machine is known as mechanical force.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h4>2. Non-Contact Forces</h4>
                <p>Non-contact forces act on objects without any physical interaction. They occur over a distance and do not require direct contact. Examples include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gravitational Force:</strong> The force of attraction between two masses, such as the Earth pulling objects toward it. This force keeps us grounded and governs the orbits of celestial bodies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Electrostatic Force:</strong> The force between charged particles. Objects with opposite charges attract each other, while those with the same charge repel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Magnetic Force:</strong> The force exerted by magnets on certain metals and other magnets. It can attract or repel depending on the magnetic poles involved.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
    
            <section>
                <h2>Understanding Pressure</h2>
                <p>Pressure is defined as the amount of force applied per unit area on a surface. It is an important concept in physics and is calculated using the formula:</p>
                <p><strong>Pressure (P) = Force (F) / Area (A)</strong></p>
    
                <h3>Importance of Pressure</h3>
                <p>Understanding pressure is crucial because it explains how forces are distributed over surfaces, affecting various physical phenomena.</p>
    
                <h3>Examples of Pressure in Daily Life</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Footprints in Sand:</strong> When you walk on sand, the pressure you exert is greater than that of the surrounding sand, leaving footprints.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sharp Knife:</strong> A sharp knife has a thin edge, allowing it to exert high pressure to cut through food easily.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inflating a Balloon:</strong> The air inside the balloon exerts pressure outward, causing it to expand.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>Atmospheric Pressure</h3>
                <p>Atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted by the weight of air in the atmosphere. It changes with altitude:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Higher Altitudes:</strong> As you climb a mountain, the air becomes thinner, and atmospheric pressure decreases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Effects of Low Pressure:</strong> Low atmospheric pressure can cause weather changes and affect our ability to breathe.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>Measuring Pressure</h3>
                <p>Pressure is measured in units called Pascals (Pa). For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1 Pascal (Pa):</strong> Equal to 1 Newton per square meter (N/mÂ²).</li>
                    <li><strong>Higher Units:</strong> Pressure can also be expressed in kilopascals (kPa) or atmospheres (atm) for practical applications.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
    
            <section>
                <h2>Understanding Friction</h2>
                <p>Friction is a force that opposes the motion of two surfaces in contact. It plays a vital role in everyday activities, both helping and hindering various processes.</p>
                
                <h3>Types of Friction</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Static Friction:</strong> The friction that prevents an object from starting to move when a force is applied.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sliding Friction:</strong> It is the opposing force that comes in play when two bodies actually slide over the surface of another body.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rolling Friction:</strong> The friction that occurs when an object rolls over a surface, such as a wheel or a ball.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>Examples of Friction in Daily Life</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Friction between shoes and the ground allows us to walk without slipping.</li>
                    <li><strong>Writing with a Pencil:</strong> Friction between the pencil tip and paper makes it possible to create marks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Driving a Car:</strong> Friction between car tires and the road surface allows for controlled movement and stopping.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Friction</h3>
                <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Friction enables activities such as walking, driving, and gripping objects. Without friction, these would not be possible.</p>
                <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Friction can cause wear and tear on machinery and reduce efficiency due to the energy lost as heat.</p>
